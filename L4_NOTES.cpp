WHAT IS UML DIAGRAM IN LLD ?
// This is just a placeholder, as the question is about UML and not C++ code.
// UML diagrams are created using specialized software and are not directly represented in code.
// This file can contain C++ code that implements the design represented by UML diagrams.

UML stands for Unified Modeling Language. It's a standard graphical notation used to visualize, specify, construct, and document the artifacts of a software-intensive system. Think of it as a blueprint language for software.

In the context of Low-Level Design (LLD), UML diagrams are incredibly useful for detailing the internal workings of individual components or modules identified during the High-Level Design (HLD) phase. While HLD focuses on the overall architecture, major components, and their interactions at a high level, LLD dives deep into the specifics.

Here's how UML is typically used in LLD:

Detailing Class Structure: The most common UML diagram used in LLD is the Class Diagram. It shows the classes within a module, their attributes (data members), operations (methods), and the relationships between them (like association, aggregation, composition, inheritance, and realization). This provides a clear picture of how the data and behavior are organized within a component.
Illustrating Interactions: Sequence Diagrams are often used in LLD to show the step-by-step interactions between objects over time for a specific use case or scenario. This helps visualize the flow of control and method calls, which is crucial for understanding the dynamic behavior of the system at a detailed level.
Modeling Behavior: Activity Diagrams can be used to model the workflow or process within an operation or a set of operations. State Machine Diagrams (or Statechart Diagrams) are useful for modeling the lifecycle of an object, showing how its state changes in response to events.
Essentially, in LLD, UML diagrams help translate the high-level architectural decisions into concrete, detailed specifications that developers can use to write code. They provide clarity on:

The exact classes needed.
The data each class holds.
The methods each class provides.
How objects of these classes interact to perform specific tasks.
The relationships and dependencies between classes.
Using UML in LLD improves communication among team members, helps identify potential design flaws early, serves as valuable documentation, and can even sometimes be used to generate code skeletons.

TYPES OF UML DIAGRAMS ?
There are several types of UML diagrams, each serving a specific purpose. They are broadly categorized into structure diagrams and behavior diagrams.

Structure Diagrams: These diagrams represent the static aspects of a system.

Class Diagram: Describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.

Component Diagram: Represents the components of a system and their interfaces. It shows the dependencies between components.

Deployment Diagram: Visualizes the physical deployment of the system's components, including nodes (e.g., servers) and the artifacts deployed on them.

Object Diagram: Shows instances of classes and their relationships at a specific point in time. It's a snapshot of the objects in a system.

Composite Structure Diagram: Illustrates the internal structure of a class or component, including its parts and connectors.

Package Diagram: Organizes the elements of a system into packages, showing the dependencies between these packages.

Behavior Diagrams: These diagrams represent the dynamic aspects of a system.

Use Case Diagram: Describes the functionality of a system from the user's perspective, showing actors (users or external systems) and use cases (the tasks they can perform).

Activity Diagram: Models the workflow or business process of a system, showing activities and the flow of control between them.

State Machine Diagram (or Statechart Diagram): Represents the states of an object and the transitions between those states in response to events.

Sequence Diagram: Shows the interactions between objects in a sequence over time, illustrating the order of messages exchanged.

Communication Diagram (or Collaboration Diagram): Similar to a sequence diagram but focuses on the relationships between objects rather than the sequence of messages. It emphasizes the objects and their links.

Interaction Overview Diagram: Provides a high-level overview of the interactions within a system, using activity diagrams to represent the flow of control between different interaction scenarios.

In LLD, Class Diagrams and Sequence Diagrams are the most frequently used, but the others can be valuable depending on the complexity and specific requirements of the module being designed.
