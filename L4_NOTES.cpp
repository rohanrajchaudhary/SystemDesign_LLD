WHAT IS UML DIAGRAM IN LLD ?
// This is just a placeholder, as the question is about UML and not C++ code.
// UML diagrams are created using specialized software and are not directly represented in code.
// This file can contain C++ code that implements the design represented by UML diagrams.

UML stands for Unified Modeling Language. It's a standard graphical notation used to visualize, specify, construct, and document the artifacts of a software-intensive system. Think of it as a blueprint language for software.

In the context of Low-Level Design (LLD), UML diagrams are incredibly useful for detailing the internal workings of individual components or modules identified during the High-Level Design (HLD) phase. While HLD focuses on the overall architecture, major components, and their interactions at a high level, LLD dives deep into the specifics.

Here's how UML is typically used in LLD:

Detailing Class Structure: The most common UML diagram used in LLD is the Class Diagram. It shows the classes within a module, their attributes (data members), operations (methods), and the relationships between them (like association, aggregation, composition, inheritance, and realization). This provides a clear picture of how the data and behavior are organized within a component.
Illustrating Interactions: Sequence Diagrams are often used in LLD to show the step-by-step interactions between objects over time for a specific use case or scenario. This helps visualize the flow of control and method calls, which is crucial for understanding the dynamic behavior of the system at a detailed level.
Modeling Behavior: Activity Diagrams can be used to model the workflow or process within an operation or a set of operations. State Machine Diagrams (or Statechart Diagrams) are useful for modeling the lifecycle of an object, showing how its state changes in response to events.
Essentially, in LLD, UML diagrams help translate the high-level architectural decisions into concrete, detailed specifications that developers can use to write code. They provide clarity on:

The exact classes needed.
The data each class holds.
The methods each class provides.
How objects of these classes interact to perform specific tasks.
The relationships and dependencies between classes.
Using UML in LLD improves communication among team members, helps identify potential design flaws early, serves as valuable documentation, and can even sometimes be used to generate code skeletons.

TYPES OF UML DIAGRAMS ?
There are several types of UML diagrams, each serving a specific purpose. They are broadly categorized into structure diagrams and behavior diagrams.

Structure Diagrams: These diagrams represent the static aspects of a system.

Class Diagram: Describes the structure of a system by showing the system's classes, their attributes, operations (or methods), and the relationships among objects.

Component Diagram: Represents the components of a system and their interfaces. It shows the dependencies between components.

Deployment Diagram: Visualizes the physical deployment of the system's components, including nodes (e.g., servers) and the artifacts deployed on them.

Object Diagram: Shows instances of classes and their relationships at a specific point in time. It's a snapshot of the objects in a system.

Composite Structure Diagram: Illustrates the internal structure of a class or component, including its parts and connectors.

Package Diagram: Organizes the elements of a system into packages, showing the dependencies between these packages.

Behavior Diagrams: These diagrams represent the dynamic aspects of a system.

Use Case Diagram: Describes the functionality of a system from the user's perspective, showing actors (users or external systems) and use cases (the tasks they can perform).

Activity Diagram: Models the workflow or business process of a system, showing activities and the flow of control between them.

State Machine Diagram (or Statechart Diagram): Represents the states of an object and the transitions between those states in response to events.

Sequence Diagram: Shows the interactions between objects in a sequence over time, illustrating the order of messages exchanged.

Communication Diagram (or Collaboration Diagram): Similar to a sequence diagram but focuses on the relationships between objects rather than the sequence of messages. It emphasizes the objects and their links.

Interaction Overview Diagram: Provides a high-level overview of the interactions within a system, using activity diagrams to represent the flow of control between different interaction scenarios.

In LLD, Class Diagrams and Sequence Diagrams are the most frequently used, but the others can be valuable depending on the complexity and specific requirements of the module being designed.




// NOTATION OF ACCESS MODIFIER IN UML DIAGRAMS ?

// In UML diagrams, access modifiers are represented using specific symbols before the attribute or method names. The common access modifiers and their notations are as follows:
// //
// // 1. Public (+): Indicates that the attribute or method is accessible from any other class.
// // 2. Private (-): Indicates that the attribute or method is accessible only within the class itself.
// // 3. Protected (#): Indicates that the attribute or method is accessible within the class and its subclasses.


HOW TO REPRESENT CLASS STRUCTURE IN UML DIAGRAMS?

// In UML diagrams, class structure is represented using Class Diagrams. A class diagram consists of the following components:

// 1. Class Name: The name of the class is written at the top of the rectangle. 
//    It is usually centered and bolded.
//    The class name is typically written in a larger font size than the other components.

// 2. Attributes: The attributes (or properties) of the class are listed in the second compartment of the rectangle. Each attribute is typically preceded by its access modifier (+ for public, - for private, # for protected) and may include the type of the attribute.
//    For example:
//    - +name: String
// 3. Methods: The methods (or operations) of the class are listed in the third compartment of the rectangle. Each method is also preceded by its access modifier and may include the return type.  

// 4. Relationships: Lines connecting classes represent relationships such as inheritance (solid line with a closed arrowhead), association (solid line), aggregation (solid line with a diamond at the end), and composition (solid line with a filled diamond at the end).
// 5. Multiplicity: Indicates how many instances of one class can be associated with another class (e.g., 1, 0..1, *, etc.).

// 6. Notes: Additional information or comments can be added using notes, which are represented as rectangles with a folded corner connected to the class with a dashed line.

what is assosiation in UML?
// In UML, association is a relationship between two classes that establishes a connection between them. It indicates that one class (the client) uses or interacts with another class (the supplier). The association can be unidirectional (one-way) or bidirectional (two-way).


how many types of association in UML?
// In UML, there are several types of associations that can be used to represent relationships between classes. The main types of associations include:
class association and object association are the two main types of association in UML.
class association have one type i.e. inheritance
// object association have three types i.e. aggregation and composition and simple association

// 1. Simple Association: This is a basic relationship where one class is associated with another class. It can be unidirectional (one-way) or bidirectional (two-way). For example, a "Teacher" class may be associated with a "Student" class.notation of simple association is a solid line connecting the two classes, with an optional arrow indicating the direction of the association.

// 2. Aggregation: This is a "has-a" relationship where one class (the whole) contains or is composed of other classes (the parts). The parts can exist independently of the whole. For example, a "Library" class may aggregate "Book" classes.
notation of aggregation is diamond shape where a common thing that conncet more different classes.

// 3. Composition: This is a stronger form of aggregation where the parts cannot exist independently of the whole. If the whole is destroyed, the parts are also destroyed. For example, a "House" class may be composed of "Room" classes. it represents a strong ownership relationship. The notation for composition is a filled diamond shape at the end of the association line, indicating that the class on that end owns the other class.

// 4. Inheritance: This belongs to  "is a relationship"  where one class (the child or derived class) inherits attributes and methods from another class (the parent or base class). It establishes an "is-a" relationship. For example, a "Dog" class may inherit from an "Animal" class.notation of inheritance is a solid line with a closed arrowhead pointing from the derived class to the base class, indicating the direction of inheritance.

sequence diagram
// A sequence diagram is a type of interaction diagram that shows how objects interact in a particular scenario of a use case. It emphasizes the time order of messages exchanged between objects. Sequence diagrams are used to model the dynamic behavior of a system and illustrate how objects collaborate to achieve a specific task or functionality.
basically it is way to connect different classes and their methods or functions.

lifeline in sequence diagram?

// In a sequence diagram, a lifeline represents the existence of an object over time. It is depicted as a vertical dashed line that extends downward from the object or actor at the top of the diagram. The lifeline indicates the duration of the object's existence during the interaction and is used to show when messages are sent to and from that object.
// Each lifeline is associated with an object or actor, and the messages exchanged between lifelines are shown as horizontal arrows that connect to the lifelines. The lifeline helps visualize the sequence of interactions and the timing of messages in the context of the overall scenario being modeled.

activation bar in sequence diagram?

// An activation bar (or execution specification) in a sequence diagram represents the period during which an object is active or controlling the flow of messages. It is depicted as a thin rectangle that is placed on top of a lifeline, extending vertically to indicate the duration of the object's activation.

what is asynchronous message in sequence diagram?
// An asynchronous message in a sequence diagram is a type of message that is sent from one object to another without waiting for a response. It indicates that the sender does not need to wait for the receiver to process the message before continuing its own execution. Asynchronous messages are typically represented by a solid line with an open arrowhead pointing to the receiving lifeline.
// This means that the sender can continue its operations immediately after sending the message, allowing for concurrent processing. Asynchronous messages are often used in scenarios where the sender and receiver can operate independently, such as in event-driven systems or when using callbacks.
// In contrast, synchronous messages (represented by a solid line with a filled arrowhead) require the sender to wait for a response from the receiver before continuing its execution. This distinction is important for understanding the flow of control and interactions between objects in a sequence diagram.

what is synchronous message in sequence diagram?
// A synchronous message in a sequence diagram is a type of message that is sent from one object to another, where the sender waits for a response from the receiver before continuing its execution. It indicates that the sender is blocked until the receiver processes the message and returns control.
// Synchronous messages are typically represented by a solid line with a filled arrowhead pointing to the receiving lifeline. The filled arrowhead indicates that the sender is expecting a response, and the activation bar on the receiving lifeline shows the duration of the receiver's processing.
// This type of message is commonly used in scenarios where the sender needs to wait for a result or confirmation from the receiver before proceeding with its own operations. Synchronous messages are often used in request-response interactions, such as method calls in object-oriented programming.
// In contrast, asynchronous messages (represented by a solid line with an open arrowhead) allow the sender to continue its execution without waiting for a response from the receiver. This distinction is important for understanding the flow of control and interactions between objects in a sequence diagram.


NOTE : WE ARE ABLE TO SEND THE MESSAGE TILL ACTIVATION BAR AREA .

ABOUT CREATE MESSAGE IN SEQUENCE DIAGRAM?
// In a sequence diagram, a "create" message is used to indicate the instantiation of a new object. It represents the action of creating an instance of a class or object during the interaction. The create message is typically represented by a dashed line with an open arrowhead pointing from the lifeline of the object that is sending the message to the lifeline of the object that is being created.
// The create message is often accompanied by a label that specifies the name of the class being instantiated. This message indicates that the sender is requesting the creation of a new object, and it may also include any parameters required for the constructor of the new object.
// The create message is useful for modeling scenarios where new objects are dynamically created during the execution of a system, such as in response to user actions or events. It helps visualize the flow of control and the relationships between objects in a sequence diagram.

// In summary, the create message in a sequence diagram represents the instantiation of a new object and is depicted as a dashed line with an open arrowhead pointing to the lifeline of the newly created object. It helps illustrate the dynamic behavior of the system and the interactions between objects during the execution of a use case.

WHAT IS DESTROY MESSAGE IN SEQUENCE DIAGRAM?
// In a sequence diagram, a "destroy" message is used to indicate the termination or destruction of an object. It represents the action of removing an instance of a class or object from memory during the interaction. The destroy message is typically represented by a large "X" symbol at the end of the lifeline of the object being destroyed.
// The destroy message indicates that the object is no longer needed and will be removed from the system. This can occur as a result of various conditions, such as the completion of a task, an error condition, or explicit user action.
// The destroy message is useful for modeling scenarios where objects are dynamically created and destroyed during the execution of a system, such as in response to user actions or events. It helps visualize the flow of control and the lifecycle of objects in a sequence diagram.

// In summary, the destroy message in a sequence diagram represents the termination of an object and is depicted as a large "X" symbol at the end of the lifeline of the object being destroyed. It helps illustrate the dynamic behavior of the system and the interactions between objects during the execution of a use case.


WHAT IS LOOS MESSAGE IN SEQUENCE DIAGRAM?
// In a sequence diagram, a "lost message" refers to a situation where a message is sent to an object that does not exist or has already been destroyed. This can occur when the sender attempts to communicate with an object that has not been created yet or has already been removed from the system.
// A lost message is typically represented by a dashed line with an open arrowhead pointing to the lifeline of the object that is not present. The dashed line indicates that the message is not successfully delivered, and the open arrowhead signifies that the sender does not receive a response.
// Lost messages are often used to illustrate error conditions or exceptional scenarios in a sequence diagram. They help visualize the flow of control and the interactions between objects, highlighting potential issues that may arise during the execution of a system.


// In summary, a lost message in a sequence diagram represents a situation where a message is sent to an object that does not exist or has already been destroyed. It is depicted as a dashed line with an open arrowhead pointing to the lifeline of the non-existent object, helping to illustrate error conditions or exceptional scenarios in the system's interactions.


 WHAT IS RETURN OR FOUND MESSAGE IN SEQUENCE DIAGRAM?
// In a sequence diagram, a "return message" represents the response sent back from a called object to the calling object after processing a synchronous message. It indicates that the called object has completed its operation and is returning control to the caller, along with any result or output.    
// The return message is typically represented by a dashed line with an open arrowhead pointing back to the lifeline of the calling object. The dashed line indicates that it is a return message, and the open arrowhead signifies that the caller is not waiting for this response.
// The return message may also include a label that specifies the return value or result being sent back to the caller. This helps clarify the outcome of the operation performed by the called object.
// Return messages are useful for modeling scenarios where objects interact and exchange information, such as method calls in object-oriented programming. They help visualize the flow of control and the interactions between objects during the execution of a use case.
// In summary, a return message in a sequence diagram represents the response sent back from a called object to the calling object after processing a synchronous message. It is depicted as a dashed line with an open arrowhead pointing back to the lifeline of the calling object, helping to illustrate the flow of control and interactions between objects in the system.

IS RETURN MESSAGE AND FOUND MESSAGE SAME?
// Yes, in the context of sequence diagrams, "return message" and "found message" refer to the same concept. Both terms describe the response sent back from a called object to the calling object after processing a synchronous message. The return message indicates that the called object has completed its operation and is returning control to the caller, along with any result or output.


DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OPTION AND ALT IN SEQUENCE DIAGRAM?
// In a sequence diagram, "opt" and "alt" are both used to represent conditional behavior, but they serve different purposes and have distinct meanings:
// 1. Opt (Optional): The "opt" fragment is used to represent an optional behavior or condition that may or may not occur during the interaction. It indicates that the enclosed messages will only be executed if a specific condition is true. If the condition is false, the messages within the "opt" fragment are skipped. 
// The "opt" fragment is typically represented by a rectangle with a dashed line around it, and the condition is specified at the top of the rectangle.IT SHOW ONLY IF CONDITION.
//
// Example: If a user is logged in, display the user's profile information.
//
// 2. Alt (Alternative): The "alt" fragment is used to represent alternative paths or branches in the interaction. It indicates that one of several possible behaviors will occur based on the evaluation of conditions. Each branch within the "alt" fragment has its own condition, and only the messages in the selected branch will be executed.
// The "alt" fragment is typically represented by a rectangle with a dashed line around it, and each branch is labeled with its respective condition.IT SHOW IF CONDITION AND ELSE CONDITION.
//
// Example: If the user is logged in, display the user's profile information; otherwise, display a login prompt.
// In summary, the key difference is that "opt" represents a single optional behavior based on a condition, while "alt" represents multiple alternative behaviors, with each branch having its own condition. Both are useful for modeling conditional interactions in sequence diagrams.


ABOUT LOOP IN SEQUENCE DIAGRAM?
// In a sequence diagram, a "loop" fragment is used to represent a repetitive behavior or iteration in the interaction. It indicates that a set of messages will be executed multiple times based on a specified condition or for a defined number of iterations. The loop fragment allows you to model scenarios where certain actions are repeated until a specific condition is met or for a certain number of times.
// The loop fragment is typically represented by a rectangle with a dashed line around it, and the condition or iteration count is specified at the top of the rectangle. The messages inside the loop fragment are executed repeatedly according to the defined condition or count.
//
For example, you might use a loop fragment to model a scenario where a user is prompted to enter their password until they provide the correct one or until a maximum number of attempts is reached.
