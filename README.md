# 📝 C++ Low-Level Design (LLD) Notes 🚀

## 🧱 Core LLD Concepts in C++

### 🏗️ SOLID Principles
The foundation of robust C++ design lies in SOLID principles - Single Responsibility keeps classes focused, Open-Closed enables extension without modification, Liskov Substitution ensures derived class compatibility, Interface Segregation prevents fat interfaces, and Dependency Inversion decouples high-level modules from implementations.

### 🧩 Design Patterns
C++ offers powerful pattern implementations - Singleton for unique instances, Factory for object creation, Observer for event handling, Strategy for interchangeable algorithms, and Decorator for dynamic responsibilities. Each pattern solves specific design challenges elegantly.

### 🧠 OOP Pillars
C++ shines with encapsulation (access modifiers), inheritance (base-derived relationships), polymorphism (virtual functions), and abstraction (pure virtuals). Templates add generic programming capabilities beyond traditional OOP.

### 📊 UML Relationships
Understanding associations (has-a), compositions (strong has-a), aggregations (weak has-a), and generalizations (is-a) is crucial for modeling C++ systems. Dependency and realization relationships complete the architectural picture.

### ⚙️ Memory Management
Smart pointers (unique_ptr, shared_ptr) modernize C++ resource handling. RAII principles tie resource lifespan to object lifetime, while move semantics enable efficient transfers of ownership.

### 🔗 Standard Library Components
Effective LLD leverages STL containers (vector, map), algorithms (sort, find), and utilities (tuple, optional). Understanding iterator categories and allocators enables custom container design.

### 🏷️ Template Metaprogramming
C++ templates enable compile-time polymorphism and code generation. CRTP (Curiously Recurring Template Pattern) facilitates static polymorphism, while SFINAE enables template specialization.

### 🧵 Concurrency Patterns
Thread-safe designs employ mutexes, condition variables, and atomic operations. Patterns like Monitor Object and Active Object help manage thread interactions in C++ systems.

### 🔄 API Design Considerations
Good C++ APIs exhibit clear ownership semantics, exception safety guarantees (basic, strong, noexcept), and proper const-correctness. PIMPL idiom aids in maintaining binary compatibility.

### 🛠️ Debugging & Maintenance
Effective logging strategies, assertion usage, and proper unit testing approaches keep C++ designs maintainable. Understanding vtable layout aids in debugging polymorphic behavior.
