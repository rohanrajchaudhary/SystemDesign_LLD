INTRODUCTION TO SYSTEM DESIGN?

// 1. System Design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data for a system to satisfy specified requirements.
// 2. It is a high-level design that focuses on the overall structure and organization of the system.
// 3. System design is typically divided into two main phases: high-level design (HLD) and low-level design (LLD).
// 4. High-level design focuses on the overall architecture and components of the system, while low-level design focuses on the implementation details of each component.
// 5. System design is an important part of software engineering and is used to create scalable, maintainable, and efficient systems.
// 6. It involves analyzing requirements, creating design documents, and making decisions about technology stacks, frameworks, and tools.
// 7. System design is a critical skill for software engineers, especially those working on large-scale systems or distributed systems.
// 8. It requires a deep understanding of software architecture, design patterns, and best practices.


 WHAT IS LLD?

// Focus on Implementation Details: LLD is primarily concerned with the how. It delves into the specific implementation details of each individual component or module that was identified during High-Level Design (HLD).
// Component-Specific Design: It involves designing the internal logic, data structures, algorithms, class structures, function signatures, and interfaces for each module or component of the system.
// Blueprint for Developers: LLD documents serve as a detailed guide or blueprint for software developers. They provide enough information for developers to directly start coding the components.
// Detailed Artifacts: The outputs of LLD often include:
// Class diagrams (showing attributes, methods, and relationships).
// Sequence diagrams (illustrating object interactions for specific scenarios).
// Database schemas (defining tables, columns, data types, and relationships).
// Detailed pseudo-code or flowcharts for complex algorithms.
// API contracts and interface definitions.
// Bridge between HLD and Code: LLD acts as a crucial bridge, translating the architectural vision from HLD into a concrete, implementable plan for the coding phase.
// Granular Level of Detail: Unlike HLD, which looks at the system from a bird's-eye view, LLD zooms in on the nitty-gritty details of each part.
// In essence, if HLD tells you what components are needed and how they broadly interact, LLD tells you how each of those components will actually be built and function internally.


 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DSA AND LLD?

// 1. Focus:
//    - DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) focuses on solving computational problems using efficient algorithms and data structures.
//    - LLD (Low-Level Design) focuses on designing the internal structure and implementation details of software components.

// 2. Scope:
//    - DSA is more about problem-solving and optimizing code for performance, memory usage, and scalability.
//    - LLD is about creating a blueprint for software development, including class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and API contracts.

// 3. Application:
//    - DSA is used to solve coding problems, optimize existing solutions, and prepare for competitive programming or coding interviews.
//    - LLD is used in software development to design and implement maintainable and scalable systems.

// 4. Output:
//    - DSA results in algorithms and data structures that solve specific problems.
//    - LLD results in detailed design documents and implementation plans for software components.

// 5. Tools:
//    - DSA involves coding, debugging, and testing algorithms.
//    - LLD involves creating UML diagrams, pseudo-code, and interface definitions.

// 6. Audience:
//    - DSA is typically learned and used by students, competitive programmers, and developers preparing for interviews.
//    - LLD is used by software engineers and architects working on real-world projects.


 DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HLD AND LLD?

// 1. Focus:
//    - HLD (High-Level Design) focuses on the overall architecture and structure of the system.
//    - LLD (Low-Level Design) focuses on the detailed implementation of individual components or modules.

// 2. Scope:
//    - HLD provides a bird's-eye view of the system, including major components, their interactions, and data flow.
//    - LLD zooms in on the specifics, such as class structures, algorithms, and interface definitions for each component.

// 3. Output:
//    - HLD results in architectural diagrams, module descriptions, and technology stack decisions.
//    - LLD results in class diagrams, sequence diagrams, pseudo-code, and detailed design documents.

// 4. Audience:
//    - HLD is typically aimed at stakeholders, architects, and senior engineers to understand the system's architecture.
//    - LLD is aimed at developers to provide a clear blueprint for implementation.

// 5. Abstraction Level:
//    - HLD is abstract and focuses on "what" the system will do.
//    - LLD is concrete and focuses on "how" the system will be implemented.

// 6. Tools:
//    - HLD may involve tools like architectural diagrams, flowcharts, and system context diagrams.
//    - LLD involves tools like UML diagrams, sequence diagrams, and database schemas.

// 7. Dependency:
//    - HLD is created first and serves as the foundation for LLD.
//    - LLD builds upon the HLD to provide detailed implementation guidance.


HOW LLD , HLD AND DSA ARE RELATED AND HELP TO MAKE ANY APPLICATION ?

// LLD (Low-Level Design), HLD (High-Level Design), and DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) are interconnected and play crucial roles in building any application. Here's how they are related and contribute:

// 1. High-Level Design (HLD):
// Purpose: HLD provides the architectural blueprint of the system. It defines the overall structure, major components, and their interactions.
// Role in Application Development:
// Helps in understanding the system's architecture.
// Guides technology stack decisions and defines the data flow between components.
// Ensures scalability, maintainability, and alignment with business requirements.
// 2. Low-Level Design (LLD):
// Purpose: LLD focuses on the detailed implementation of each component identified in HLD.
// Role in Application Development:
// Provides detailed class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and pseudo-code.
// Acts as a bridge between HLD and actual coding.
// Ensures that each component is implemented correctly and adheres to the design principles.
// 3. Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA):
// Purpose: DSA provides the foundation for solving computational problems efficiently.
// Role in Application Development:
// Optimizes the performance of the application by using appropriate data structures and algorithms.
// Helps in implementing the logic for individual components designed in LLD.
// Ensures efficient memory usage and scalability.
// How They Work Together:
// HLD: Defines what the system will do and provides a high-level view of the system.
// LLD: Breaks down the HLD into detailed designs, focusing on how each component will be implemented.
// DSA: Provides the tools and techniques to implement the logic and functionality of the components designed in LLD.
// Example Workflow:
// HLD Phase: Decide on the architecture of an e-commerce application (e.g., microservices for user management, product catalog, and order processing).
// LLD Phase: Design the internal structure of the "Order Processing" service, including class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and API contracts.
// DSA Phase: Implement efficient algorithms for tasks like searching products, calculating discounts, or managing inventory.
// By combining these three, developers can create robust, scalable, and efficient applications.

NOTE = IF DSA IS THE BRAIN OF AN APPLICATION THEN LLD IS THE SKELETON OF AN APPLICATION.
